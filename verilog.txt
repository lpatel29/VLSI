Verilog is a HARDWARE DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE (HDL). A hardware description language is a language used to describe a digital system: for example, a network switch, a 
microprocessor or a memory or a simple flip-flop. This just means that, by using a HDL, one can describe any (digital) hardware at any level.

 // D flip-flop Code
module d_ff ( d, clk, q, q_bar);
input d ,clk;
output q, q_bar;
wire d ,clk;
reg q, q_bar;
  	 
always @ (posedge clk)
begin
  q <= d;
  q_bar <= !d;
end

endmodule
